Brief Summary: This project aims to provide the ability to modify the singleplayer
portion of the IW4 engine, very similar to the way IW4M (FourDeltaOne) allowed.

=================================================================================

Installation/ Utilization: Place d3d9.dll in your root Modern Warfare 2 folder.  
The modified files of your choice should be put in their respective folders within  
the new data folder that gets automatically created by the dll.  A few examples...

Example 1: rootMW2FolderDirectory\data\english\localizedstrings\example.str  
Example 2: rootMW2FolderDirectory\data\ui\scriptmenus\pausedmenu.menu  
Example 3: rootMW2FolderDirectory\data\maps\estate.gsc
